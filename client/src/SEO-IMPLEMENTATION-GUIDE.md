## ðŸš€ Deployment Requirements

### For Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Generation (SSG)

**IMPORTANT:** The current implementation uses client-side React Router. For maximum SEO benefit, you should deploy using one of these approaches:

#### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel automatically handles SSR/SSG for React applications:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import repository to Vercel
3. Vercel auto-configures build and routing
4. Add custom domain `powerplantenergy.com.au`

#### Option 2: Next.js Conversion (Future Enhancement)
Convert the application to Next.js for:
- Built-in SSR/SSG capabilities
- Automatic code splitting
- Optimized image loading
- Better Core Web Vitals scores

This would involve:
1. Migrating to Next.js App Router
2. Converting pages to use `generateMetadata()` for SEO
3. Using Next.js `<Image>` component for optimization
4. Implementing ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for dynamic content

#### Option 3: Prerendering Service
Use a prerendering service (like Prerender.io or Rendertron) to:
- Serve static HTML to crawlers
- Serve React app to users
- Maintain single codebase

### Required Configuration Files

When deploying, ensure you include:

```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.27.0",
    "lucide-react": "latest",
    ...
  }
}
```

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      './components': '/components',
      './pages': '/pages',
      './styles': '/styles'
    }
  }
});
```

## ðŸ“Š Post-Launch Monitoring

### Google Search Console Setup

1. **Verify domain** at https://search.google.com/search-console
2. **Submit sitemap:** https://powerplantenergy.com.au/sitemap.xml
3. **Request indexing** for all main pages
4. **Monitor coverage** for indexing errors

Track these metrics:
- Total impressions (target: 1,000+ per month within 3 months)
- Average position for target keywords
- Click-through rate (target: 2-5% for position 1-10)
- Index coverage (all 8 pages should be indexed within 2 weeks)

### Bing Webmaster Tools

Same process as Google:
1. Verify domain
2. Submit sitemap
3. Monitor indexing and rankings

### Analytics Setup

Implement Google Analytics 4 or similar to track:
- Organic traffic vs referral/direct
- Bounce rate (target: <60%)
- Average session duration (target: 2+ minutes)
- Pages per session (target: 2+)
- Conversion events (contact form submissions, email clicks)

### Technical Monitoring

#### Core Web Vitals
Run monthly audits via PageSpeed Insights:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Target <2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay):** Target <100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Target <0.1

#### Crawl Audits
Use Screaming Frog or Sitebulb monthly to check:
- Broken links (404s)
- Redirect chains
- Missing meta descriptions
- Duplicate content
- Image optimization issues
